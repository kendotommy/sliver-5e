On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the sliver. A creature that chooses to not be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.
On a failed save, the sliver enters the creature’s space and the engulfed creature takes 7 (3d4) psychic damage and it is engulfed.

<text>When the sliver reduces a creature’s hit points to 0 while it is engulfed, the sliver can use its reaction to form a protective chrysalis and evolve into a more complex sliver.
The sliver becomes Stunned, and its AC becomes 17. It also gains temporary hit points, and remains in the chrysalis a number of rounds, based on the sliver’s evolution modifier.
The sliver can choose to evolve into a Sliver Harbinger, using the stats provided at the bottom of the chart, or roll on the Sliver Broodling Evolution Chart. When the sliver emerges from the chrysalis it loses all of its abilities and becomes the sliver you rolled for.

<trait>
<name>Shimmering Crest</name>
<text>
When a creature that can see the front of the sliver's head starts its turn within 15 feet of the sliver and in an area of bright light, the sliver can force it to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw if the sliver isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is restored by the Greater Restoration spell or other similar magic.
Unless surpressed, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the sliver until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the sliver in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.
If the sliver sees itself reflected on a polished surface within 15 feet of it and in an area of bright light, the sliver is, due to a curse, affected by its own gaze.

<name>Corrosive Touch</name>
<text>
The sliver corrodes a nonmagical ferrous metal object it can see wtihin 5 feet of it. If the object isn't being worn or carried, the touch destroys a 1-foot cube of it. If the object is being worn or carried by a creature, the creature can make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to avoid the silver's touch.
If the object touched is either metal armor or a metal shield being worn or carried, it takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penaltyto the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield that drops to a +0 bonus is destroyed. If the object touched is a held metal weapon, it rusts as described in the Rust Metal feature.
